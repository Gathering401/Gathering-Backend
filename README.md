# Gathering-Backend

This is an API built through the ASP .NET Core framework using C#.  
This API will be used to fuel the frontend that will eventually be built as a full web application.  
  
Gathering is a place to create events that can be shared with certain groups of people.  
One user can be part of multiple groups, can create events, inviting whatever groups they might be a part of.  
Using Twilio for event notifications through text messages. People can respond to accept or decline invites, or Twilio can just remind the user of upcoming events.

## Goals for the Future

As for where we want to take this, a few of the features that we've thought of so far include (in no particular order):

* Route to leave a group (done)
* Route to remove a member from a group as an admin
* Route to delete a group (for groups that are no longer active) (oops, this should be on frontend as *button* to delete group)
* Poll system
* Recurring events
* Get event host working"
